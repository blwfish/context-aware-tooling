### Laser Modules (swappable)

| Module | Type | Wavelength | Notes |
|--------|------|-----------|-------|
| 10W diode | Blue diode | ~450 nm | General cutting/engraving |
| 20W diode | Blue diode | ~450 nm | Faster/thicker than 10W |
| 40W diode | Blue diode | ~450 nm | Current primary module |
| 2W IR | IR diode | ~1064 nm | Marks metals, clear acrylic |

### Laser Type × Material Compatibility

Laser wavelength is a **hard filter** — settings don't transfer across types:

- **Blue diode (~450 nm)**: wood, leather, dark materials, anodized aluminum. Clear acrylic is transparent to it — won't cut.
- **IR diode (~1064 nm)**: marks metals and clear acrylic that blue diode can't process.
- **CO2 (~10.6 μm)**: (not this machine) absorbed by organics and clear acrylic; can't mark bare metal without coating.
- **UV (~355 nm)**: (not this machine) "cold" process — marks without charring.

## Focus & Setup

- Focal length: fixed (module sets focus height via spacer/autofocus)
- Focus method: autofocus or manual spacer
- Air assist: built-in

## Safety

- Enclosure: S1 is enclosed — still use ventilation/filtration
- Never leave unattended during cutting
- Keep fire extinguisher accessible

## Software: xTool Creative Space (XCS)

- Supports SVG, DXF, PNG, JPG
- Can import from LightBurn if needed
